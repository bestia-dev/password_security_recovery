## Public and private

Like in normal life, also in our digital life we have public and private things.

Many things in life are public. Everybody can use them. For example a web site like google search is public. Nobody will get jealous if somebody else uses google search. It is public.  

But some things are private. For example my email is private. I don't want anybody to read my emails. It is not important why, this is a philosophical question. It is simply in human nature that we don't want to share everything with everybody else.  

And sometimes there is mix of this two. We allow guests to use our bathroom, but we don't want them to go into our bedroom.

To protect our private things we use keys, passwords or similar mechanisms.  
Only with that "key" we can access our private things. That way if a thief wants to open a door, he cannot do it without the key. At least not easily and quietly.  

## Passwords

Passwords are easy. Everybody understands passwords.  
But many don't understand that password don't live alone. Passwords are always tightly coupled with a username and a "service".  
A very simple analogy is that:

- the "service" is like a house
- the username is like a specific door in that house
- the password is like the key for that door for that house

## Good practice

All door keys are different in real life. You cannot open all the doors in a street with the same key. The same should apply for passwords too. Most of the passwords must be unique, never reuse the same password for different things. The danger is that if a hacker finds one of your passwords, he will try it on every service. If the password is the same, he will have access to everything. If the passwords are different he will have access limited just to one single service. At least for the most important passwords make them different.  

## First class passwords

Not all passwords are equal. It depends how important is the private thing that is protecting.

The password for our bank account is *very important*. If a thief finds this password he can steal all out money. That would be very bad.  

But a password for a free service like "free cooking recipes" is *not very important*. If the password is hacked, nothing terrible will happen. There is no money involved.

Then there is the *very important* password that protects our "digital identity". For example, if we forget the "cooking recipe" password, we can recover it easily. These kind of services have a "forgot password" button and they send a link to recover it to your email.  
**Aha! "To your email" !**  
This means that our email must not be compromised. If a thief can access our email, he can change all passwords of our less important services. That is not good. So simply put our email is our "digital identity".  

The "first class" passwords are used to protect:  

- bank accounts, digital wallets, debit card PIN and anything around money
- digital identity (emails, google account, facebook account, government issued certificates)
- password managers for "second class" passwords
- encrypted private files (VeraCrypt, Cryptomator, ...)
- normal private files (Dropbox, GDrive, OneDrive, Windows account)

Fortunately there are not a lot of these "first class" passwords.
These passwords are so important that you MUST learn them by heart and never forget them. The easiest way to learn is by using them often. If you use a password once a week you will not forget it. If you use it once a year it is 100% sure you will forget it. Never use any password manager to store them, because that way you will forget them and it is dangerous.

You must somehow be able to store these super important passwords, but never do it in a digital form because it can be hacked. Write them on a paper and store it in a bank vault or hide them really really good. Like your life depends on it!

## Second class passwords

And then there are "second class" passwords. You can relax here. They don't protect anything valuable. You can use a "password manager" for them. There is a lot of these passwords, more then 100. Everywhere on the internet you create an account, use the password manager to store it. But always ask yourself if you are creating a "second class" or a "first class" password. The answer to this question must be precise. If there is danger to loose money if hacked then this is a "first class" password and must not go into the password manager.






## Passwor managers

Just that everybody regularly forget their passwords


## 2FA - two factor authentication

## authenticator

## Digital identity

## Certificates

## SSH keys and passcodes
